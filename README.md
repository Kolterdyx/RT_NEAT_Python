# RT_NEAT_Python

This is my attempt at implementing the NEAT algorithm by Kenneth O. Stanley without the generational constraint, allowing for real time processing and evolving of the network.


## Is this repo dead?

Probably. Coding is just a hobby for me so I tend to abandon things for months out of nowhere when they get too hard. This is by far the hardest project I've ever started so chances are that I won't finish it. Feel free to fork it though, although my code is a mess
