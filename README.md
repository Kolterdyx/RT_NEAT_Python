# Real Time NEAT for Python

This is my attempt at implementing the NEAT algorithm by Kenneth O. Stanley without the generational constraint,
allowing for real time processing and evolving of the network.

### Todo list
* Speciation
* Crossover
* Configuration system
  * Config class used by the Network class.
  * Configuration parser

### Current goals
* Evolve a XOR network generation by generation. (Traditional [NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf))
* Evolve a XOR network in real time. ([RTNEAT](www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/downloads/papers/stanley.aiide05demo.pdf))


## Is this repo dead?

Probably. Coding is just a hobby for me so I tend to abandon things for months out of nowhere when they get too hard.
This is by far the hardest project I've ever started so chances are that I won't finish it. Feel free to fork it though,
although my code is a mess
